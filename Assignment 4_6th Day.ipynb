    "A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike other collections in Python, there is no index attached to the elements of the set, i.e., we cannot directly access any element of the set by the index. However, we can print them all together, or we can get the list of elements by looping through the set.\n",
    "It can contain any type of element such as integer, float, tuple etc. But mutable elements (list, dictionary, set) can't be a member of set.\n",

    "Union of two Sets\n",
    "The union of two sets is calculated by using the pipe (|) operator. The union of the two sets contains all the items that are present in both the sets.\n",
    "Intersection of two sets\n",
    "The intersection of two sets can be performed by the and & operator or the intersection() function. The intersection of the two sets is given as the set of the elements that common in both sets.\n",
    "Difference between the two sets\n",
    "The difference of two sets can be calculated by using the subtraction (-) operator or intersection() method. Suppose there are two sets A and B, and the difference is A-B that denotes the resulting set will be obtained that element of A, which is not present in the set B.\n",
    "Symmetric Difference of two sets\n",
    "The symmetric difference of two sets is calculated by ^ operator or symmetric_difference() method.\n",
    "Set comparisons\n",
    "Python allows us to use the comparison operators i.e., <, >, <=, >= , == with the sets by using which we can check whether a set is a subset, superset, or equivalent to other set. The boolean true or false is returned depending upon the items present inside the sets."
